## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Payment Security
Implementing secure payment processing while maintaining good UX.

**Solution**: Integrated Stripe with proper webhook handling for payment confirmations and used their secure payment elements for PCI compliance.

### Challenge: Performance Optimization
Handling large product catalogs efficiently.

**Solution**: Implemented server-side pagination, image optimization with Next.js Image component, and database indexing for faster queries.

### Challenge: State Management
Managing complex application state across components.

**Solution**: Used React Context for global state with useReducer for complex state logic, complemented by SWR for server state management.

## Code Examples

### Product API Endpoint
```typescript
// api/products/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const page = parseInt(searchParams.get('page') || '1');
  const limit = parseInt(searchParams.get('limit') || '12');
  const category = searchParams.get('category');

  const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: category ? { categoryId: category } : {},
    skip: (page - 1) * limit,
    take: limit,
    include: {
      category: true,
      images: true
    }
  });

  return NextResponse.json({ products, page, hasMore: products.length === limit });
}
```

### Shopping Cart Hook
```typescript
// hooks/useCart.ts
export const useCart = () => {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<CartItem[]>([]);

  const addItem = useCallback((product: Product, quantity: number = 1) => {
    setItems(prev => {
      const existingItem = prev.find(item => item.id === product.id);
      if (existingItem) {
        return prev.map(item =>
          item.id === product.id
            ? { ...item, quantity: item.quantity + quantity }
            : item
        );
      }
      return [...prev, { ...product, quantity }];
    });
  }, []);

  const total = useMemo(() =>
    items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity, 0),
    [items]
  );

  return { items, addItem, removeItem, total };
};
```
